## [Sound the Alarm: Detection and Response](https://www.coursera.org/learn/detection-and-response?specialization=google-cybersecurity)

## About this Course

This is the sixth course in the Google Cybersecurity Certificate. These courses will equip you with the skills you need to apply for an entry-level cybersecurity job. Youâ€™ll build on your understanding of the topics that were introduced in the fifth Google Cybersecurity Certificate course.

In this course, you will focus on incident detection and response. You'll define a security incident and explain the incident response lifecycle, including the roles and responsibilities of incident response teams. You'll analyze and interpret network communications to detect security incidents using packet sniffing tools to capture network traffic. By assessing and analyzing artifacts, you'll explore the incident investigation and response processes and procedures. Additionally, you'll practice using Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Security Information Event Management (SIEM) tools.

Google employees who currently work in cybersecurity will guide you through videos, provide hands-on activities and examples that simulate common cybersecurity tasks, and help you build your skills to prepare for jobs.

Learners who complete this certificate will be equipped to apply for entry-level cybersecurity roles. No previous experience is necessary.
