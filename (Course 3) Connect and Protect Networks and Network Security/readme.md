## [Connect and Protect: Networks and Network Security](https://www.coursera.org/learn/networks-and-network-security?specialization=google-cybersecurity)

## About this Course

This is the third course in the Google Cybersecurity Certificate. These courses will equip you with the skills you need to apply for an entry-level cybersecurity job. Youâ€™ll build on your understanding of the topics that were introduced in the second Google Cybersecurity Certificate course.

In this course, you will explore how networks connect multiple devices and allow them to communicate. You'll start with the fundamentals of modern networking operations and protocols. For example, you'll learn about the Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) model and how network hardware, like routers and modems, allow your computer to send and receive information on the internet. Then, you'll learn about network security. Organizations often store and send valuable information on their networks, so networks are common targets of cyber attacks. By the end of this course, you'll be able to recognize network-level vulnerabilities, and explain how to secure a network using firewalls, system hardening, and virtual private networks.

Google employees who currently work in cybersecurity will guide you through videos, provide hands-on activities and examples that simulate common cybersecurity tasks, and help you build your skills to prepare for jobs.

Learners who complete this certificate will be equipped to apply for entry-level cybersecurity roles. No previous experience is necessary.
