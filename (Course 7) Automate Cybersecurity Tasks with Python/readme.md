## About this Course

This is the seventh course in the Google Cybersecurity Certificate. These courses will equip you with the skills you need to apply for an entry-level cybersecurity job. Youâ€™ll build on your understanding of the topics that were introduced in the sixth Google Cybersecurity Certificate course.

In this course, you will be introduced to the Python programming language and apply it in a cybersecurity setting to automate tasks. You'll start by focusing on foundational Python programming concepts, including data types, variables, conditional statements, and iterative statements. You'll also learn to work with Python effectively by developing functions, using libraries and modules, and making your code readable. In addition, you'll work with string and list data, and learn how to import, parse and debug files.  

Google employees who currently work in cybersecurity will guide you through videos, provide hands-on activities and examples that simulate common cybersecurity tasks, and help you build your skills to prepare for jobs. 

Learners who complete this certificate will be equipped to apply for entry-level cybersecurity roles. No previous experience is necessary.
